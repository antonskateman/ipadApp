<h1> <strong>It's an iPad App.</strong></h1>
<div id="content">All of the built-in apps on iPad were designed from the ground up to take advantage of the large Multi Touch screen and advanced capabilities of iPad. And they work in any orientation. So you can do things with these apps that you can't do on any device.
